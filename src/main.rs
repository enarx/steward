//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Steward is a critical element of the Confidential Computing infrastructure.
//! The promise of Confidential Computing is fully utilized when the workload
//! runtime (Enarx WebAssembly) deployed into a Trusted Execution Environment
//! (TEE) is assessed and verified for correctness before an actual workload
//! is released into a TEE from the registry (Drawbridge). An external
//! **attestation service** must perform evidence verification and assessment
//! of the hardware's trustworthiness.
//!
//! **Steward implements such attestation service in a modular, pluggable
//! and scalable way.**
//!
//! **Modular:** The architecture of the Trusted Execution Environments
//! significantly differs between hardware vendors. As a result, the content
//! and structure of the evidence information are vendor-specific. The Steward
//! employs modular design to process specific types of evidence in different
//! backends.
//!
//! **Pluggable:** Steward employs a pluggable and extensible architecture
//! to allow the addition of new evidence information to the evidence payload
//! as well as the support of new hardware architectures.
//!
//! **Scalable:** Steward service is stateless. It receives a request with
//! all the information from the client and makes an assessment. As a result,
//! it is very lightweight and can be scaled up and down in response to
//! the request load.
//!
//! Attesting the hardware and workload runtime is only one part of
//! the Steward's responsibility. The other is the translation of the vendor
//! and use-case-specific attestation evidence into a format that standard
//! services and interfaces on the Internet can trust. Such a standard is PKI,
//! so Steward acts as a Certificate Authority that assesses the attestation
//! evidence and issues a certificate based on this evidence. The certificate
//! is returned to the workload and used by it to participate in
//! the authenticated data exchanges with other services over the encrypted
//! connections.
//!
